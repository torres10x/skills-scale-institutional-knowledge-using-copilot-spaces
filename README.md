# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview
OctoAcme follows a structured, lightweight project management approach to keep work prioritized, visible, and high-quality. Projects start with a clear initiation step to define goals, success criteria, and stakeholders. Planning breaks work into prioritized backlog items (epics, stories, tasks) with effort estimates and acceptance criteria. Execution uses short iterations and PR-based development: branches for features, linked issues, code reviews, and automated CI gates. Releases are prepared through release branches or tags, validated in staging with smoke tests, and documented in a changelog.

Communication balances synchronous meetings (standups, sprint planning, retrospectives) with asynchronous documentation (issues, PRs, design docs, and the files in this docs/ folder) to ensure traceability and reduce context loss. Roles and personas are defined so responsibilities (Product Owner, Engineering Lead, Developers, QA, DevOps, and stakeholder reviewers) are clear for each item. Quality assurance is enforced with automated CI (linting, unit/integration tests, security scans), mandatory reviews, environment-based testing, and a pre-release checklist. Continuous improvement is formalized through retrospectives and measurement of delivery metrics (lead time, cycle time, defect rate).
